# AI System Compatibility — Human Verification

## Principle

**Even when a provider or interface is documented as compatible, a human must verify compatibility.** Automated or doc-based “compatible” claims are not sufficient for release or reliance. Each item in the todos above requires a human to run the relevant flow in a real environment and confirm behavior.

## Scope

- **Providers:** Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (cloud), OpenCode, Ollama, llama-server (GGUF), LLM Studio (or equivalent).
- **Interfaces:** CLI (e.g. Codex, Claude Code), Desktop (Electron + Ollama), API (OpenAI-compatible `model_endpoint`).

## Reference

- Full compatibility analysis: [AI_SYSTEM_COMPATIBILITY_REVIEW.md](../Reports%20and%20Reviews/AI_SYSTEM_COMPATIBILITY_REVIEW.md)
- Config: `Orchestration/Memories/SETTINGS.json` (`model_endpoint`, `default_model`)
- Desktop spec: `Orchestration/Agents/AGENT_PROMPT.md`, `Documentation/PRDs/FEATURES_PRD.md`

## Verification checklist (summary)

| Id | Item | Human action |
|----|------|--------------|
| verify-ollama | Ollama | Run Desktop app (or client) against local Ollama; confirm chat, streaming, model list, errors. |
| verify-llama-server | llama-server (GGUF) | Run `docker-compose up llama-server`, point agent/config at :8080; confirm completions. |
| verify-openai-cloud | OpenAI cloud | If implemented: set endpoint + key, run a completion; confirm behavior and docs. |
| verify-anthropic | Anthropic (Claude) | If implemented: run adapter against Claude API; confirm mapping and config. |
| verify-opencode | OpenCode | When integration exists: run OpenCode CLI/API against dotAi; document findings. |
| verify-llm-studio | LLM Studio | Point `model_endpoint` at LM Studio (or equivalent) server; confirm completions and model name. |
| verify-cli | CLI | Run dotAi via Codex/Claude Code (or other runtime); confirm START_HERE, config, endpoint. |
| verify-desktop | Desktop | Install and run Electron app; confirm Ollama connection, UI, guard rails. |
| verify-api | API | Use SETTINGS `model_endpoint` with one backend; confirm chat completions and overrides. |
| update-compatibility-review | Update review doc | After verifications, add dates, environment, and caveats to AI_SYSTEM_COMPATIBILITY_REVIEW.md. |

## Completion

When all todos are verified and the review doc is updated, mark each todo `status: completed` in this PRD and optionally add a short “Last verified” note (date, environment) at the top of [AI_SYSTEM_COMPATIBILITY_REVIEW.md](../AI_SYSTEM_COMPATIBILITY_REVIEW.md).
