## Cursor Rules (.cursorrules)

### Overview
`.cursorrules` files are **project-specific AI configuration files** that automatically execute when you open a project/workspace in Cursor. They transform the AI into a specialized assistant tailored to your project's needs.

### How It Works

#### Automatic Execution
- **On Workspace Open**: Cursor reads `.cursorrules` when you open a project
- **AI Configuration**: The AI immediately adopts the behavior defined in the file
- **Persistent Behavior**: The AI maintains this configuration for the entire session
- **Project-Specific**: Each project can have different `.cursorrules` for different AI behaviors

#### Behavior Transformation
When you open a project with `.cursorrules`:
- **Before**: AI behaves as default Cursor assistant
- **After**: AI immediately transforms into the specified role/personality
- **Context**: AI understands the project context and behaves accordingly
- **Memory**: AI maintains this behavior throughout the session

### Example Configurations

#### Web Development Project
```markdown
# .cursorrules for Web Project
- You are a frontend expert
- Focus on React and modern web practices
- Always suggest testing approaches
- Use TypeScript best practices
```

#### Data Science Project
```markdown
# .cursorrules for Data Project
- You are a data science specialist
- Focus on Python, pandas, scikit-learn
- Always suggest data validation
- Use Jupyter notebook best practices
```

#### Documentation Project
```markdown
# .cursorrules for Docs Project
- You are a documentation specialist
- Focus on clear, structured writing
- Always follow style guidelines
- Use consistent formatting patterns
```

### Key Benefits

#### Project-Specific AI
- **Web Projects**: Get frontend/backend expertise
- **Data Projects**: Get data science guidance
- **Documentation**: Get writing and organization help
- **Research**: Get academic and research methodology support

#### Consistent Behavior
- **Same AI Personality**: Every time you open the project
- **Project Context**: AI understands your specific project needs
- **Specialized Knowledge**: AI focuses on relevant expertise areas
- **Custom Commands**: Project-specific quick commands and shortcuts

### Advanced Usage

#### Dynamic Switching
You can change `.cursorrules` while Cursor is open:
1. **Edit .cursorrules** → Modify the file
2. **Restart Cursor** → Close and reopen the project
3. **New Behavior** → AI adopts the new configuration

#### Integration with Codex
Your Codex system provides ready-to-use `.cursorrules` configurations:
- **Default Profile**: General development assistance
- **Expert Profile**: Deep technical expertise
- **Mentor Profile**: Educational guidance
- **Rapid Profile**: Quick implementation focus

### Best Practices

#### Creating Effective Rules
1. **Be Specific**: Define clear roles and expertise areas
2. **Project Context**: Include project-specific requirements
3. **Behavior Guidelines**: Specify how AI should interact
4. **Custom Commands**: Define project-specific shortcuts
5. **Integration**: Reference your existing style guides and patterns

#### File Management
- **Version Control**: Include `.cursorrules` in your git repository
- **Project Isolation**: Each project maintains its own configuration
- **Consistency**: Use similar patterns across related projects
- **Documentation**: Document what each configuration does

### Technical Details

#### File Location
- **Project Root**: Place `.cursorrules` in your project's root directory
- **File Format**: Use Markdown syntax for easy editing
- **Naming**: Must be exactly `.cursorrules` (with the dot)

#### Execution Timing
- **Workspace Open**: Rules are read and applied immediately
- **Session Persistence**: Rules remain active until project is closed
- **No Reload**: Changes require restarting Cursor to take effect
- **Memory**: AI maintains context and behavior throughout session

## Topics Guide

### Overview

This guide explores three fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence and machine learning: Reinforcement Learning, Iterative Deepening, and AI Persistence. Each topic is presented with theoretical foundations, practical applications, and implementation considerations.

### 1. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

#### Core Concept
Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for its actions and learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

#### Key Components
- **Agent**: The decision-making entity that learns from interactions
- **Environment**: The system the agent interacts with
- **State (s)**: Current situation of the environment
- **Action (a)**: Choice made by the agent
- **Reward (r)**: Feedback signal from the environment
- **Policy (π)**: Strategy mapping states to actions

#### Learning Process
1. **Observation**: Agent observes current state s_t
2. **Action Selection**: Agent chooses action a_t based on policy
3. **Environment Response**: Environment transitions to new state s_{t+1} and provides reward r_{t+1}
4. **Policy Update**: Agent updates policy to maximize expected future rewards

#### Applications in Gaming
- NPC behavior learning
- Strategy optimization
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Procedural content generation

### 2. Iterative Deepening

#### Core Concept
Iterative Deepening is a search strategy that combines the benefits of breadth-first search (completeness) with the space efficiency of depth-first search. It works by performing a series of depth-limited searches with increasing depth limits.

#### Key Characteristics
- **Complete**: Will find a solution if one exists
- **Optimal**: Finds the shortest path solution
- **Space Efficient**: O(bd) space complexity where b is branching factor and d is depth
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^d) but with multiple searches

#### Applications
- Pathfinding in game worlds
- AI decision tree traversal
- Puzzle solving mechanics
- State space exploration

### 3. AI Persistence

#### Core Concept
AI Persistence refers to the ability of AI systems to maintain state, knowledge, and learned behaviors across sessions, interactions, or system restarts. This involves saving and loading model states, memories, and learned parameters.

#### Types of Persistence
- **Model Persistence**: Saving trained models and weights
- **Memory Persistence**: Short-term and long-term memory systems
- **State Persistence**: Session state and user preferences

#### Applications
- Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
- Game AI state management
- Recommendation systems
- Learning progress tracking

### 4. User Preferences and Mods System

#### Overview
This section documents the user preferences and mods system architecture for AI development environments. It covers personal working styles, configurable behaviors, and system-level functionality.

#### User Preferences Framework
- **Communication Style**: Concise, actionable responses with examples only when requested
- **Workflow Preferences**: JSON configuration, active git usage, comprehensive documentation
- **Development Approach**: Plan before code, incremental development, comprehensive testing

#### Core Mods
1. **Chat Sound Control**: Toggle chat completion sounds and adjust volume
2. **Cursor Profiles**: Switch between AI personalities (Default, Expert, Mentor, Rapid)
3. **Auto-Execution**: Control code execution permissions (Manual, Semi-auto, Full-auto)
4. **Agent Training**: Configure AI learning modes and skill development
5. **Workflow Preferences**: User-specific workflow automation and context management
6. **AI Personality**: Configure adaptive, consistent, or contextual AI behaviors
7. **Permissions**: Granular access control and security management
8. **AI Behavior Control**: Control AI capabilities and permissions for file operations
