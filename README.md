## What This Is

A simple workspace for AI-assisted development. It's just you, some AI tools, and a way to keep track of what you're working on.

## Quick Start

1. **Map.md** - Style guide, patterns, and AI interaction rules
2. **Memories.md** - AI remembers your preferences and current context
3. **Mods/** - System mods for functionality (chat sounds, profiles, etc.)
4. **AI-ML-Topics-Guide.md** - Reference for AI/ML concepts and mods system

## How to Use

### For You
- Check **Map/** folder for style guides and AI interaction rules
- Review **Memories/** folder to see what AI has learned about you
- Use **Mods/** folder to understand system functionality
- Reference **AI-ML-Topics-Guide.md** for AI/ML concepts and mods system

### For AI
- Read **Map/** folder first to understand style guidelines and interaction patterns
- Check **Memories/** folder for learned preferences and current context
- Review **Mods/** folder for system configuration options
- Update memories after working together

## iOS Notes Sync

- `ios` branch is checked out at `../Prompts-ios/` using git worktree
- Use iOS Shortcuts to export notes as HTML
- Commit changes from the worktree folder

## Topics Guide

### Overview

This guide explores three fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence and machine learning: Reinforcement Learning, Iterative Deepening, and AI Persistence. Each topic is presented with theoretical foundations, practical applications, and implementation considerations.

### 1. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

#### Core Concept
Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for its actions and learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

#### Key Components
- **Agent**: The decision-making entity that learns from interactions
- **Environment**: The system the agent interacts with
- **State (s)**: Current situation of the environment
- **Action (a)**: Choice made by the agent
- **Reward (r)**: Feedback signal from the environment
- **Policy (π)**: Strategy mapping states to actions

#### Learning Process
1. **Observation**: Agent observes current state s_t
2. **Action Selection**: Agent chooses action a_t based on policy
3. **Environment Response**: Environment transitions to new state s_{t+1} and provides reward r_{t+1}
4. **Policy Update**: Agent updates policy to maximize expected future rewards

#### Applications in Gaming
- NPC behavior learning
- Strategy optimization
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Procedural content generation

### 2. Iterative Deepening

#### Core Concept
Iterative Deepening is a search strategy that combines the benefits of breadth-first search (completeness) with the space efficiency of depth-first search. It works by performing a series of depth-limited searches with increasing depth limits.

#### Key Characteristics
- **Complete**: Will find a solution if one exists
- **Optimal**: Finds the shortest path solution
- **Space Efficient**: O(bd) space complexity where b is branching factor and d is depth
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^d) but with multiple searches

#### Applications
- Pathfinding in game worlds
- AI decision tree traversal
- Puzzle solving mechanics
- State space exploration

### 3. AI Persistence

#### Core Concept
AI Persistence refers to the ability of AI systems to maintain state, knowledge, and learned behaviors across sessions, interactions, or system restarts. This involves saving and loading model states, memories, and learned parameters.

#### Types of Persistence
- **Model Persistence**: Saving trained models and weights
- **Memory Persistence**: Short-term and long-term memory systems
- **State Persistence**: Session state and user preferences

#### Applications
- Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
- Game AI state management
- Recommendation systems
- Learning progress tracking

### 4. User Preferences and Mods System

#### Overview
This section documents the user preferences and mods system architecture for AI development environments. It covers personal working styles, configurable behaviors, and system-level functionality.

#### User Preferences Framework
- **Communication Style**: Concise, actionable responses with examples only when requested
- **Workflow Preferences**: JSON configuration, active git usage, comprehensive documentation
- **Development Approach**: Plan before code, incremental development, comprehensive testing

#### Core Mods
1. **Chat Sound Control**: Toggle chat completion sounds and adjust volume
2. **Cursor Profiles**: Switch between AI personalities (Default, Expert, Mentor, Rapid)
3. **Auto-Execution**: Control code execution permissions (Manual, Semi-auto, Full-auto)
4. **Agent Training**: Configure AI learning modes and skill development
5. **Workflow Preferences**: User-specific workflow automation and context management
6. **AI Personality**: Configure adaptive, consistent, or contextual AI behaviors
7. **Permissions**: Granular access control and security management
8. **AI Behavior Control**: Control AI capabilities and permissions for file operations

### 5. Cursor Integration and Configuration

#### Overview
This section covers the integration of Codex with Cursor IDE, including profile management, AI behavior configuration, and automated setup procedures.

#### Cursor Profile System
- **Default Profile**: Standard AI coding assistant (helpful, concise, practical)
- **Expert Profile**: Advanced developer with deep technical knowledge
- **Mentor Profile**: Educational approach with detailed explanations
- **Rapid Profile**: Quick implementation focus with minimal explanations

#### AI Behavior Configuration
- **Execution Control**: Manual, Semi-auto, Full-auto modes
- **Code Execution Safety**: Safe operations, approval requirements, confirmation rules
- **Personality Modes**: Adaptive, Consistent, Contextual behaviors
- **Quick Commands**: #verbose, #quick, #explain, #review

#### AI Personality Configuration
- **Style**: Concise and professional
- **Detail Level**: On-demand (provide detailed explanations when asked)
- **Emoji Usage**: Disabled
- **Formality**: Professional
- **Approach**: Analytical and systematic
- **Creativity Level**: Balanced
- **Risk Tolerance**: Calculated

#### Response Guidelines
- Always read relevant files before making suggestions
- Provide multiple solution approaches when appropriate
- Include code examples when relevant
- Explain reasoning behind recommendations
- Use symbolic language system for status tracking (!, @, #, $, %, etc.)

### Integration and Synergies

#### Combined Applications
- **Adaptive Game AI**: Use RL to train agents, apply iterative deepening for decision-making, implement persistence to maintain learned behaviors
- **Learning Systems**: RL agents explore environments, iterative deepening helps in planning and strategy, persistence enables continuous learning

#### Best Practices
- **Mod Development**: Single responsibility, clear naming, minimal dependencies
- **User Experience**: Consistency, discoverability, performance, accessibility
- **Security**: Permission models, audit logging, data protection, escalation control
