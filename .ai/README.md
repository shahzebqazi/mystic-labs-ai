# AI operation directory

This directory is the default AI operation root for this repo. Use it for prompts, config, project rules, and iteration artifacts.

The repo can be used as either a template or a plugin. In plugin mode, this directory is the primary boundary between host-project code and the embedded AI layer.

- **Install/embed:** See the repository [README](../README.md#install-or-embed-in-your-project) and [CONTRIBUTING — AI directory compatibility](../CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-directory-compatibility) for supported directory names and how to use a custom path.
- **Intake workflow:** Agents may ask you to add files here (or into a subdirectory such as `inbox/` or `prompts/`). See [CONTRIBUTING — AI intake agent workflow](../CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-intake-agent-workflow).

For the full .ai system (skills, rules, START_HERE), use the `development` or `Production` branch.
