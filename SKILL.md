description: Curate and maintain a legally downloadable EPUB library with license-aware sourcing and local collection audits. Use when the user asks to find Creative Commons, open-source, public-domain, or otherwise legally free EPUBs; verify download rights; review an existing ebook folder; or manage a Git-tracked library catalog.

# Library Librarian

## Overview

Maintain a clean, legal, token-efficient EPUB catalog and local library audit process.

Use `Librarian.md` as the schema contract for all saved records.

## Workflow

1. Decide mode.
- `prompt mode`: Ask user what genres, languages, eras, and licenses they prefer.
- `review mode`: Scan a local folder and summarize the collection.

2. Gather legal sources only.
- Prefer `references/legal-epub-sources.md`.
- Keep only sources with explicit public-domain, Creative Commons, GNU/open license, or equivalent legal free-use terms.
- Store a source citation URL and retrieval date for each source.

3. Save data in token-efficient records.
- Use `Librarian.md` structures (`SourceRecord`, `BookRecord`, `TokenCard`, `CollectionSnapshot`).
- Prefer concise enum fields and short keys in token cards.

4. Run local review script when auditing existing books.
- Command:
```bash
python3 scripts/review_collection.py --root "/Volumes/X4-SD/Author Letter Bucket Collection"
```

5. Run bucket-count updater to track counts per A-Z folder.
- One-shot update:
```bash
python3 scripts/update_letter_bucket_counts.py
```
- Continuous auto-update when books are added:
```bash
python3 scripts/update_letter_bucket_counts.py --watch --interval-seconds 10
```

6. Track all changes in Git.
- Initialize once: `git init`
- Stage: `git add .`
- Commit: `git commit -m "Update library catalog"`
- Review diffs before committing.

## Output Expectations

For each curation run, produce:

1. A legal-source shortlist with licenses.
2. A compact token-card list for candidate books.
3. A collection snapshot report if review mode is used.
4. A letter-bucket report with per-directory counts and changed buckets.
5. A Git commit capturing catalog/report changes.

## Files in This Skill

- `Librarian.md`: schema definitions and token-saving rules.
- `references/legal-epub-sources.md`: vetted legal source list + starter links.
- `references/seed-catalog.jsonl`: starter book records.
- `scripts/review_collection.py`: local collection scanner and token-card generator.
- `scripts/update_letter_bucket_counts.py`: A-Z bucket counter with auto-update watch mode.
